            Your first day at Moorim High. You'd been anticipating coming here for as long as you could remember. The most elite High School in district A, known not only for it's academic excellence but for it's social benefits. If you can't level up your social life here forget about doing it anywhere else. 
            <p>You couldn't contain your excitement when your mother told you she'd successfully enrolled you here right after moving to the city, now looking at the school you feel... how do you feel?</p>
